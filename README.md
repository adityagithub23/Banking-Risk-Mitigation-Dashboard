# Home Credit Default Risk - Story-Driven Professional Dashboard

## üéØ Project Overview

This project creates a comprehensive, story-driven dashboard for Home Credit's lending business that transforms complex financial data into actionable business insights. The dashboard tells a complete narrative through 6 sequential chapters, making credit risk analysis accessible to any stakeholder.

## üìñ Dashboard Story Flow

The dashboard follows a logical progression that mirrors the customer journey and business decision-making process:

### Chapter 1: WHO ARE OUR CUSTOMERS?
Understanding the customer base and their basic characteristics

### Chapter 2: WHAT DO OUR CUSTOMERS WANT?
Analyzing loan applications and credit requirements

### Chapter 3: HOW DO WE DECIDE?
Understanding the approval and rejection patterns

### Chapter 4: WHAT'S THEIR CREDIT HISTORY?
Analyzing external credit bureau data

### Chapter 5: HOW DO CUSTOMERS PAY?
Analyzing payment behavior and installment patterns

### Chapter 6: THE FINAL ANSWER - WHO DEFAULTS?
Combining all data to understand comprehensive risk patterns

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources

The dashboard integrates multiple data sources to provide a 360-degree view of customer risk:

| Dataset | Description | Key Metrics |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `application_train.csv` | Main application data with target variable | Demographics, income, loan details, default status |
| `previous_application.csv` | Previous application history | Application success rates, rejection reasons |
| `bureau.csv` | Credit bureau data | Credit history, active loans, payment behavior |
| `bureau_balance.csv` | Monthly balances from credit bureau | Payment status, utilization patterns |
| `installments_payments.csv` | Payment history for Home Credit loans | Payment timeliness, amount variance |

### Sample Query
```sql
-- Example: Customer Age Distribution (Chapter 1)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN FLOOR(ABS(DAYS_BIRTH)/365.25) BETWEEN 18 AND 25 THEN '18-25 (Young Adults)'
        WHEN FLOOR(ABS(DAYS_BIRTH)/365.25) BETWEEN 26 AND 35 THEN '26-35 (Young Professionals)'
        WHEN FLOOR(ABS(DAYS_BIRTH)/365.25) BETWEEN 36 AND 45 THEN '36-45 (Established Adults)'
        WHEN FLOOR(ABS(DAYS_BIRTH)/365.25) BETWEEN 46 AND 55 THEN '46-55 (Middle-aged)'
        WHEN FLOOR(ABS(DAYS_BIRTH)/365.25) BETWEEN 56 AND 65 THEN '56-65 (Pre-retirement)'
        ELSE '65+ (Senior Citizens)'
    END as AGE_GROUP,
    COUNT(*) as CUSTOMER_COUNT,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM application_train), 2) as PERCENTAGE
FROM application_train 
WHERE DAYS_BIRTH IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY AGE_GROUP
ORDER BY MIN(FLOOR(ABS(DAYS_BIRTH)/365.25))
